# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using Python's `tkinter` library. The game allows two players to take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of their symbols to win the game. The app also includes a reset option to start a new game.

## Features

- **Two Players**: The game supports two players, X and O, who take turns playing.
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically detects when a player has won by forming a line of three symbols.
- **Draw Detection**: The game detects when the board is full and no player has won, resulting in a draw.
- **Reset Option**: A reset button is provided to clear the board and start a new game.
